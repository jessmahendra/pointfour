# Item-Specific Reviews Implementation

## Overview
This implementation enhances the fashion recommendations extension to provide both brand-level fit summaries (from the database) and specific item reviews (from web search) in a unified, intelligent display.

## Key Features

### 1. Enhanced Item Detection
- **Improved Title Parsing**: Better extraction of product names like "Micah pants" from page titles
- **URL Analysis**: Enhanced parsing of product URLs to identify specific items
- **Smart Filtering**: Removes common website suffixes, size indicators, and color names

### 2. Dual-Source Review System
- **Database Brand Data**: Shows existing brand fit summaries (e.g., "Reformation runs small")
- **Dynamic Web Search**: Searches for specific item reviews (e.g., "Reformation Micah pants fit review")
- **Combined Display**: Presents both sources together for comprehensive information

### 3. Intelligent Search Queries
- **Brand Fit Summary**: `"Reformation" ("runs small" OR "fits large" OR "true to size") (site:reddit.com OR site:styleforum.net)`
- **Item-Specific Reviews**: `"Reformation Micah pants" (review OR "fit review" OR sizing OR "how does it fit") (site:reddit.com OR site:styleforum.net OR site:instagram.com OR site:substack.com)`
- **Item Quality Reviews**: `"Reformation Micah pants" (quality OR "after wash" OR shrunk OR pilled OR durability) (site:reddit.com OR site:styleforum.net OR site:substack.com OR site:youtube.com)`

### 4. Smart Review Classification
- **Relevance Scoring**: Automatically identifies how relevant each review is to the specific item
- **Item-Specific Highlighting**: Visually distinguishes reviews that mention the exact product
- **Priority Sorting**: Shows most relevant reviews first

### 5. Enhanced UI Components
- **Brand Fit Summary Section**: Green-highlighted box showing database fit information
- **Item-Specific Reviews**: Green-bordered reviews that mention the specific product
- **General Reviews**: Standard yellow-bordered reviews from web search
- **Relevance Badges**: Clear indicators of review relevance
