# Phase 2B: User Review Upload Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive community review system that allows users to submit, view, and filter reviews with photos. The system includes a points/rewards mechanism and integrates user reviews into AI recommendations.

## What Was Completed

### 1. Database Schema ✅
**Files created:**
- `/supabase/migrations/20250107_add_review_photos_and_points.sql`
- `/supabase/setup_storage.sql`

**Tables added:**
- `review_photos` - Stores up to 5 photos per review with display order
- `user_points` - Tracks total points accumulated by users
- `points_transactions` - Audit log for all point changes

**Features:**
- Automatic points awarding via database trigger (10 base points + 2 per photo, max 10 bonus)
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies for all tables
- Cascade delete relationships
- Measurements snapshot stored with each review

**To apply:**
1. Run the SQL in `/supabase/migrations/20250107_add_review_photos_and_points.sql` in your Supabase dashboard SQL editor
2. Run the SQL in `/supabase/setup_storage.sql` to set up the storage bucket

### 2. API Endpoints ✅
**Files created:**
- `/src/app/api/reviews/submit/route.ts` - Submit new reviews
- `/src/app/api/reviews/upload-photo/route.ts` - Upload review photos
- `/src/app/api/reviews/[id]/route.ts` - Get, update, delete reviews
- `/src/app/api/reviews/product/[productId]/route.ts` - Fetch reviews for a product with filtering

**Features:**
- Authentication required for all mutations
- Photo upload validation (type, size, count)
- Ownership verification for edit/delete
- Similar measurements filtering (within 10% tolerance)
- Sort by: most recent, highest rated, most helpful

### 3. UI Components ✅
**Files created:**

- Size worn input
- Review text area
- Photo upload with preview (max 5, 5MB each)
- Real-time validation
- Points display ("You'll earn X points!")
- Filter by similar measurements
- Sort options
- Photo gallery per review

### 4. AI Integration ✅
**Files modified:**
- `/src/prompts/fashion-recommendations.ts`

**New functions:**
- `buildCommunityReviewsContext()` - Formats user reviews for AI context
- Updated prompt interface to include `communityReviews`

**Features:**
- Community reviews prioritized over external reviews in AI recommendations
- Measurements snapshot included in AI context
- Fit ratings and size worn information provided to AI

### 5. Product Page Integration ✅
**Files modified:**
- `/src/app/products/[id]/ProductPageClient.tsx`

**Features:**
- "Review" button added next to Share button
- Links to review submission page with product info pre-filled

### 6. Storage Configuration ✅
- Supabase Storage bucket: `review-photos`
- Path structure: `{user_id}/{review_id}/{photo_filename}`
- Public read access
- Authenticated users can upload
- Users can only delete their own photos

## How to Use

### For Users:
1. **Submit a Review:**
   - Navigate to any product page
   - Click the "Review" button in the top-right corner
   - Fill in required fields: rating, fit, size worn, review text
   - Optionally upload up to 5 photos
   - Submit to earn points (10 base + up to 10 bonus for photos)

2. **View Community Reviews:**
   - Reviews will be displayed on product pages (you'll need to add `<UserReviewsSection productId={productId} />` to ProductRecommendations component)
   - Toggle "Similar to me" filter to see reviews from users with similar measurements
   - Sort by most recent, highest rated, or most helpful

3. **Edit/Delete Reviews:**
   - API endpoints support edit and delete
   - Users can only modify their own reviews
   - UI for edit/delete can be added later

### For Developers:

#### To integrate UserReviewsSection into product pages:
```tsx
// In your product page component (e.g., ProductRecommendations.tsx)
import { UserReviewsSection } from "@/components/UserReviewsSection";

// Add it to your JSX
<UserReviewsSection productId={product.id} className="mt-8" />
```

#### To integrate community reviews into AI recommendations:
```tsx
// In your recommendation generation logic
import { buildCommunityReviewsContext } from "@/prompts/fashion-recommendations";

// Fetch community reviews
const response = await fetch(`/api/reviews/product/${productId}`);
const { reviews } = await response.json();

// Build context
const communityReviewsContext = buildCommunityReviewsContext(reviews);

// Pass to AI prompt
const prompt = buildFashionRecommendationsPrompt({
  query,
  enhancedContext,
  userContext,
  communityReviews: communityReviewsContext
});
```

## What's Not Yet Implemented

### Points/Rewards System UI
The database and backend logic for points is complete, but you'll need to add:
- API endpoint to fetch user's total points: `GET /api/points`
- Display user points in profile/navbar
- Points history page showing transactions
- Rewards redemption system (if desired)

### Review Moderation
- Reviews are auto-approved
- To add manual moderation:
  1. Add `is_approved` boolean column to `user_reviews`
  2. Update RLS policies to filter by `is_approved = true`
  3. Create admin dashboard to approve/reject reviews

### Homepage Review Flow
- Currently, users must navigate to a product page first
- To allow direct review submission from homepage:
  1. Create a product search/select component
  2. Update homepage "Review a brand or item" card to show product selector
  3. Or redirect to `/products` page to browse and select

### Helpful/Unhelpful Voting
- `helpful_count` column exists in reviews
- Need to implement:
  - API endpoints for voting
  - Track which users voted (new table)
  - UI buttons for "Helpful" / "Not Helpful"

   - Pass to AI via `buildCommunityReviewsContext()`

4. **Test the Full Flow:**
   - Create a test review with photos
   - Verify points are awarded
   - Check filtering by similar measurements
   - Ensure reviews appear in AI recommendations

5. **Optional Enhancements:**
   - Build points display UI
   - Add review moderation dashboard
   - Implement helpful/unhelpful voting

## Architecture Notes

- **Authentication:** Uses Supabase Auth, all mutations require login
- **File Storage:** Uses Supabase Storage with RLS policies
- **Points System:** Fully automatic via database triggers
- **Measurements Snapshot:** Captures user measurements at time of review for accurate filtering
- **RLS Security:** All tables have proper row-level security policies
- **Similar Filtering:** Server-side filtering with 10% tolerance on measurements

## Questions or Issues?

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check Supabase logs for database errors
2. Verify migrations were applied successfully
3. Ensure storage bucket was created with correct policies
4. Check browser console for API errors
5. Verify user is authenticated before submitting reviews
