# Products Implementation Summary

## Directory Structure Decision

**Recommendation: Products as sibling to brands (not nested)**

```
src/app/
├── brands/
│   ├── [slug]/
│   └── page.tsx
├── products/
│   ├── [id]/
│   └── page.tsx
└── api/
    ├── brands/
    └── products/
```

### Why this structure?
1. **Independent access**: Products can be browsed without going through brands
2. **Better SEO**: Direct product URLs (`/products/123`) are cleaner
3. **Flexible filtering**: Easy to filter products by brand, category, price, etc.
4. **Consistent with current pattern**: Matches how brands are structured
5. **Future-proof**: Easier to add product categories, search, or other features

## Database Schema

### Products Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
  id bigint PRIMARY KEY GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY,
  name text NOT NULL,
  url text NOT NULL,
  brand_id bigint NOT NULL REFERENCES brands(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  description text,
  image_url text,
  price numeric(10,2),
  currency text DEFAULT 'USD',
  created_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now()
);
```

### Key Features
- Foreign key relationship to brands table
- Proper indexing for performance
- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled
- Sample data included

## API Routes

### `/api/products` (GET, POST)

### `/api/products/[id]` (GET, PUT, DELETE)

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `supabase-products-setup.sql` - Database schema
- `src/app/api/products/route.ts` - Products API
- `src/app/api/products/[id]/route.ts` - Individual product API
- `src/app/products/page.tsx` - Products list page
- `src/app/products/[id]/page.tsx` - Product detail page
- `src/app/products/[id]/not-found.tsx` - 404 page

### Modified Files

- `src/components/GlobalNavigation.tsx` - Added navigation links

## Next Steps

1. **Run the SQL setup**: Execute `supabase-products-setup.sql` in your Supabase dashboard
2. **Test the implementation**: Visit `/products` to see the products list
3. **Add sample data**: The SQL includes sample products for testing
4. **Customize styling**: Adjust colors, spacing, and layout as needed
5. **Add more features**: Consider adding product categories, search, filtering, etc.

## Usage Examples

### View all products
```
GET /products
```

### Filter by brand
```
GET /products?brand_id=1
```

### Search products
```
GET /products?search=nike
```

### Get specific product
```
GET /products/123
```

### Create product
```
POST /api/products
{
  "name": "Product Name",
  "url": "https://example.com/product",
  "brand_id": 1,
  "description": "Product description",
  "price": 99.99
}
```

The implementation provides a solid foundation for managing products with proper relationships to brands, clean URLs, and a user-friendly interface.
