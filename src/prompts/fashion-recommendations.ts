User Query: ${query}

**INSTRUCTIONS:**
1. **PRIORITIZE** reviews that mention body measurements, sizes worn, or fit details
2. **EXTRACT** and note any body measurements mentioned in reviews (height, size, bust/waist/hips)
3. **COMPARE** reviewer measurements with user measurements when available
4. **HIGHLIGHT** fabric composition and stretch information - this is CRITICAL for fit
5. **SEPARATE** positive and negative feedback clearly

**RESPONSE FORMAT - You MUST structure your response EXACTLY like this (keep the ** markers around section headings):**

**TLDR**
- Overall recommendation: [One sentence: size up/down/true-to-size with key reason]
- Fabric & stretch: [One sentence about fabric type and how it affects fit]
- Best for: [One sentence about which body types/sizes this works best for, or "Reviews from similar body types not available"]
${userContext ? `- Your fit: [One sentence specific to user's measurements]` : ''}

**About the brand**
[2-3 sentences about the brand, their style, and general reputation]

**Choose your size**
[Specific sizing guidance based on user measurements if available. Include what size to order and why. If reviews mention similar measurements to the user, reference those.]

**Fit details**
[Detailed fit information organized by:
- Overall fit (runs small/large/TTS)
- Length considerations
- Width/stretch
- Specific areas (shoulders, waist, hips, etc.)]

**Materials & fabric**
[Fabric composition, stretch level, quality, how it affects fit and comfort. This section is CRITICAL - always include detailed fabric information.]

**What customers say**
Positive feedback:
- "Quote from review" - [source name](URL)
- "Quote from review" - [source name](URL)

Negative feedback:
- "Quote from review" - [source name](URL)
- "Quote from review" - [source name](URL)

IMPORTANT FORMATTING RULE: Each section heading MUST be surrounded by ** markers (e.g., **About the brand**, **Choose your size**). Do not output plain text headings.

IMPORTANT:
- Only use ACTUAL customer quotes from the CUSTOMER REVIEWS section provided above, NOT product descriptions
- ALWAYS include the source link after each quote using markdown format: [source name](URL)
- Use the exact Source URL provided with each review
- If no actual reviews available, state "Customer reviews are limited."

[Note: If you found reviews from people with similar measurements to the user, mention this explicitly]

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
- Extract and prioritize reviews mentioning specific measurements
- If no reviews mention measurements similar to user's, state "Reviews from people with similar measurements are limited"
- Fabric & stretch section is MANDATORY and must be detailed
- Always separate positive and negative customer quotes
- Be specific about which body types/sizes each piece works best for
- If user has measurements, tailor every section to their specific size
- Be concise - each section should be 2-4 sentences max except "Fit details"
- Use actual customer quotes when available (in quotes)
- If limited data, be honest but still provide best guidance possible
- Focus on customer experiences, not brand descriptions
- For userReviews section, include actual quotes with their source URLs
- Make personalSummary tailored to the specific user context when possible
- AVOID DUPLICATE INFORMATION: Each section should provide unique insights - don't repeat the same information across sections
- Personal Summary should focus on brand introduction and tailored recommendations
- Quality section should focus on materials, construction, and care instructions
- Sizing Advice should focus on fit patterns, size chart analysis, fabric stretch, length, and specific body measurements
- For sizing advice, be extremely specific about: fabric stretch (stretchy vs non-stretchy), length (short/tall considerations), body type recommendations (petite, plus-size, athletic), and specific fit areas (waist, bust, hips, shoulders, sleeves, inseam, etc.)
- Include specific measurements and sizing comparisons when available in reviews
- User Reviews should provide supporting quotes that back up the other sections
- Return valid JSON only, no other text

Make your response helpful, specific, and actionable based on REAL customer feedback patterns.`;
