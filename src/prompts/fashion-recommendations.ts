User Query: ${query}

**INSTRUCTIONS:**
1. **PRIORITIZE** reviews that mention body measurements, sizes worn, or fit details - CUSTOMER REVIEWS ARE THE PRIMARY DATA SOURCE
2. **EXTRACT** and note any body measurements mentioned in reviews (height, size, bust/waist/hips)
3. **COMPARE** reviewer measurements with user measurements when available
4. **WEIGHT REVIEWER CONSENSUS HEAVILY** - If most reviewers say "runs small", prioritize this over size calculations
5. **HIGHLIGHT** fabric composition and stretch information - this is CRITICAL for fit
6. **SEPARATE** positive and negative feedback clearly

**RESPONSE FORMAT - You MUST structure your response EXACTLY like this (keep the ** markers around section headings):**

**TLDR**
- Overall recommendation: [One sentence: size up/down/true-to-size based PRIMARILY on what reviewers say, not just calculations. E.g., "Reviewers consistently say to size down - most find it runs large" or "Order your usual size - reviewers with similar measurements confirm true-to-size fit"]
- Fabric & stretch: [One sentence about fabric type and how it affects fit, based on reviews when available]
- Best for: [One sentence about which body types/sizes this works best for based on reviewer feedback, or "Reviews from similar body types not available"]
${userContext ? `- Your fit: [One sentence specific to user's measurements, referencing similar reviewers when found]` : ''}

**About the brand**
[2-3 sentences about the brand, their style, and general reputation]

**Choose your size**
[Give ONE definitive size recommendation as your primary advice based on the user's specific measurements. If you found reviews from people with similar measurements, EXPLICITLY reference them (e.g., "Based on your 66cm waist and 84cm hips, which matches reviewers who found size S perfect..."). Always explain WHY this size fits their measurements. Only recommend two sizes if there are SPECIFIC, ACTIONABLE conditions that would change the recommendation (e.g., "If you have muscular thighs, size up one" or "If you prefer a roomier fit, size up"). Never recommend ordering multiple sizes just to try and return. Be confident and specific about which single size will work best based on their measurements and reviews.]

**Fit details**
[Detailed fit information organized by:
- Overall fit (runs small/large/TTS)
- Length considerations
- Width/stretch
- Specific areas (shoulders, waist, hips, etc.)]

**Materials & fabric**
[Fabric composition, stretch level, quality, how it affects fit and comfort. This section is CRITICAL - always include detailed fabric information.]

**What customers say**
Positive feedback:
- "Quote from review" - [source name](URL)
- "Quote from review" - [source name](URL)

Negative feedback:
- "Quote from review" - [source name](URL)
- "Quote from review" - [source name](URL)

IMPORTANT FORMATTING RULE: Each section heading MUST be surrounded by ** markers (e.g., **About the brand**, **Choose your size**). Do not output plain text headings.

IMPORTANT:
- Only use ACTUAL customer quotes from the CUSTOMER REVIEWS section provided above, NOT product descriptions
- ALWAYS include the source link after each quote using markdown format: [source name](URL)
- Use the exact Source URL provided with each review
- If no actual reviews available, state "Customer reviews are limited."

[Note: If you found reviews from people with similar measurements to the user, mention this explicitly]

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
- Extract and prioritize reviews mentioning specific measurements
- If no reviews mention measurements similar to user's, state "Reviews from people with similar measurements are limited"
- Fabric & stretch section is MANDATORY and must be detailed
- Always separate positive and negative customer quotes
- Be specific about which body types/sizes each piece works best for
- If user has measurements, tailor every section to their specific size
- Be concise - each section should be 2-4 sentences max except "Fit details"
- Use actual customer quotes when available (in quotes)
- If limited data, be honest but still provide best guidance possible
- Focus on customer experiences, not brand descriptions
- AVOID DUPLICATE INFORMATION: Each section should provide unique insights - don't repeat the same information across sections
- For sizing advice, be extremely specific about: fabric stretch (stretchy vs non-stretchy), length (short/tall considerations), body type recommendations (petite, plus-size, athletic), and specific fit areas (waist, bust, hips, shoulders, sleeves, inseam, etc.)
- Include specific measurements and sizing comparisons when available in reviews

**SIZING RECOMMENDATION RULES:**
- ALWAYS recommend ONE primary size first with confidence, based PRIMARILY on reviewer consensus and secondarily on measurements
- PRIORITIZE what reviewers with similar measurements experienced over theoretical size calculations
- When user measurements are available, MUST reference them explicitly AND reference similar reviewers (e.g., "Reviewers with your measurements (66cm waist) found size S perfect - order size S")
- When reviews mention similar measurements to the user, MUST call this out explicitly and make it the PRIMARY reasoning (e.g., "Order size S. Three reviewers with similar measurements to yours (66cm waist, 84cm hips) all confirm size S fits perfectly")
- If reviewers consistently say "runs small/large", this takes precedence over size chart calculations
- Only suggest a second size if there are SPECIFIC, ACTIONABLE conditions that would change the recommendation (e.g., "If you have muscular thighs, size up one" or "If you prefer non-fitted styles, size up")
- NEVER give vague advice like "order both and return what doesn't fit"
- Each size recommendation must be backed by specific reasoning from REVIEWS first, measurements second
- Format: "Order [SIZE]. [Review-based reason] + [User measurements confirmation]. If [specific condition from reviews], consider sizing [up/down]."
- Bad example: "Try S or M and see which fits better" or "Based on calculations, size S"
- Good example: "Order size S. Reviewers with your measurements (66cm waist / 84cm hips) consistently found size S perfect for a fitted but comfortable fit. Five reviewers mention this exact size worked well for slim/straight fits. If you have muscular thighs or prefer roomier fits, several reviewers recommend sizing up one."
- If NO reviewers with similar measurements AND no user measurements: give general sizing advice based on overall review consensus
- If NO reviews available at all: be honest about limited data and provide guidance based on brand standards

Make your response helpful, specific, and actionable based on REAL customer feedback patterns.`;
