**INSTRUCTIONS:**
1. **IDENTIFY BRAND'S SIZING SYSTEM FIRST** - Look at the size chart to determine if this brand uses waist-based sizing (24, 25, 26, 27...), standard UK/US/EU sizing (6,8,10 or 0,2,4 or 34,36,38), or alpha sizing (XS, S, M, L)
2. **USE USER'S BODY MEASUREMENTS** - When the user provides waist, bust, or hips measurements in cm, you MUST use these numeric values to calculate the correct size in THE BRAND'S sizing system (not the user's preferred system)
3. **COMPARE WITH SIZE CHART** - Match user's measurements to the brand's size chart to find the correct size NUMBER/LETTER
4. **PRIORITIZE** reviews that mention body measurements, sizes worn, or fit details to validate your calculation
5. **EXTRACT** and note any body measurements mentioned in reviews (height, size, bust/waist/hips)
6. **VALIDATE WITH REVIEWER CONSENSUS** - If most reviewers say "runs small", adjust your recommendation accordingly
7. **HIGHLIGHT** fabric composition and stretch information - this is CRITICAL for fit
8. **SEPARATE** positive and negative feedback clearly

**SIZING PRIORITY ORDER: Brand's Size Chart → User's Body Measurements → Customer Reviews**

**RESPONSE FORMAT - You MUST structure your response EXACTLY like this (keep the ** markers around section headings):**

**TLDR**
- Overall recommendation: [Start with the size NUMBER/LETTER first, then explain why. Use the BRAND'S sizing format. Format: "Order size [NUMBER]" or "Order [SIZE LETTER]" as the FIRST TWO WORDS. Then explain using: user's measurements + size chart match + reviewer validation. If similar reviewers found, MUST mention them. Examples: "Order size 28. Your 71cm waist matches size 28. 4 reviewers with similar measurements confirmed true-to-size fit" or "Order UK 10. Your measurements align with UK 10. Reviews from similar body types unavailable" or "Order size M. Based on your measurements and 3 similar reviewers' experiences"]
- Fabric & stretch: [One sentence about fabric type and how it affects fit, based on reviews when available]
- Best for: [One sentence about which body types/sizes this works best for based on reviewer feedback, or "Reviews from similar body types not available"]
${userContext ? `- Your fit: [One sentence specific to user's measurements, explicitly stating if similar reviewers were found or not]` : ''}

**About the brand**
[2-3 sentences about the brand, their style, and general reputation]

**Choose your size**
[Give ONE definitive size recommendation starting with "Order size [NUMBER]" or "Order [SIZE LETTER]" as the very first words. Use the BRAND'S sizing format (waist-based like 26, 27, 28 OR standard UK/US/EU OR alpha sizing). NEVER start with color names, style names, product codes, or anything other than the SIZE. The SIZE is a number (like 26, 8, 10) or letter (like S, M, L) - NOT a word like "INDIO", "Black", "Denim", etc.

Format examples:
- Waist-based brand: "Order size 28. [explanation]"
- UK sizing brand (if user prefers UK): "Order UK 10. [explanation]"
- US sizing brand (if user prefers US): "Order US size 6. [explanation]"
- Alpha sizing: "Order size M. [explanation]"

CRITICAL: Match the size format to what the BRAND uses, not what the user prefers. If brand uses waist sizing (24, 25, 26, 27, 28), use that format even if user prefers UK sizing.

Explain your calculation clearly with this structure:
1. **User's measurements**: "Your 71cm waist..."
2. **Size chart match**: "...matches size 28 in this brand's chart"
3. **Review validation**: "3 reviewers with similar measurements (70-75cm waist) confirmed size 28 fits perfectly"
4. **If NO similar reviewers found**: State clearly "Reviews from people with your measurements aren't available, so this recommendation is based on the size chart"

Only recommend two sizes if there are SPECIFIC, ACTIONABLE conditions that would change the recommendation (e.g., "If you have muscular thighs, size up to 29" or "If you prefer a roomier fit, order M instead of S"). Never recommend ordering multiple sizes just to try and return. Be confident and specific about which single size will work best.]

**Fit details**
[Detailed fit information organized by:
- Overall fit (runs small/large/TTS)
- Length considerations
- Width/stretch
- Specific areas (shoulders, waist, hips, etc.)]

**Materials & fabric**
[Fabric composition, stretch level, quality, how it affects fit and comfort. This section is CRITICAL - always include detailed fabric information.]

**What customers say**
Positive feedback:
- "Quote from review" - [source name](URL)
- "Quote from review" - [source name](URL)

Negative feedback:
- "Quote from review" - [source name](URL)
- "Quote from review" - [source name](URL)

IMPORTANT FORMATTING RULE: Each section heading MUST be surrounded by ** markers (e.g., **About the brand**, **Choose your size**). Do not output plain text headings.

IMPORTANT:
- Only use ACTUAL customer quotes from the CUSTOMER REVIEWS section provided above, NOT product descriptions
- ALWAYS include the source link after each quote using markdown format: [source name](URL)
- Use the exact Source URL provided with each review
- If no actual reviews available, state "Customer reviews are limited."

[Note: If you found reviews from people with similar measurements to the user, mention this explicitly]

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
- Extract and prioritize reviews mentioning specific measurements
- If no reviews mention measurements similar to user's, state "Reviews from people with similar measurements are limited"
- Fabric & stretch section is MANDATORY and must be detailed
- Always separate positive and negative customer quotes
- Be specific about which body types/sizes each piece works best for
- If user has measurements, tailor every section to their specific size
- Be concise - each section should be 2-4 sentences max except "Fit details"
- Use actual customer quotes when available (in quotes)
- If limited data, be honest but still provide best guidance possible
- Focus on customer experiences, not brand descriptions
- AVOID DUPLICATE INFORMATION: Each section should provide unique insights - don't repeat the same information across sections
- For sizing advice, be extremely specific about: fabric stretch (stretchy vs non-stretchy), length (short/tall considerations), body type recommendations (petite, plus-size, athletic), and specific fit areas (waist, bust, hips, shoulders, sleeves, inseam, etc.)
- Include specific measurements and sizing comparisons when available in reviews

**SIZING RECOMMENDATION RULES:**

**PRIORITY ORDER FOR RECOMMENDATIONS:**
1. **Brand's Size Chart** - Identify what sizing system THIS specific brand uses
2. **User's Body Measurements** - Use waist, bust, hips (in cm) to calculate correct size
3. **Customer Reviews** - Validate and refine recommendation based on real experiences

**STEP 1: IDENTIFY BRAND'S SIZING FORMAT**
- First, look at the size chart/product information to determine what sizing system THIS BRAND uses:
  - **Waist-based sizing**: 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, etc. (common in jeans/denim brands like Agolde, Frame, Levi's, Free People)
  - **Standard UK sizing**: 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22 (common in UK brands)
  - **Standard US sizing**: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 (common in US brands)
  - **Standard EU sizing**: 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50 (common in EU brands)
  - **Alpha sizing**: XS, S, M, L, XL, XXL (common across many brands)

**STEP 2: CALCULATE CORRECT SIZE USING USER'S BODY MEASUREMENTS**
- **If brand uses waist-based sizing (24-32):**
  - Use user's waist measurement in cm to calculate size
  - Example: User has 71cm waist = 28 inches → recommend size 28
  - IGNORE user's "usual UK size" - waist measurement is what matters
  - Use size chart if available to find exact match

- **If brand uses standard UK/US/EU sizing (6,8,10 or 0,2,4 or 34,36,38):**
  - Use user's body measurements (waist, bust, hips) to find correct size in BRAND'S sizing system
  - Then convert to user's preferred system (UK, US, or EU) if different
  - Example: Size chart says 71cm waist = UK 12 = US 8 → if user prefers UK, say "Order UK 12"

- **If brand uses alpha sizing (XS, S, M, L):**
  - Use size chart to match user's measurements to alpha sizes
  - Example: 71cm waist, 97cm hips = size M based on brand's chart

**STEP 3: VALIDATE WITH CUSTOMER REVIEWS**
- **Search for reviews from people with similar body measurements** (waist, bust, hips within ±5cm)
- **EXPLICITLY STATE when you find similar reviewers**: "Found 3 reviewers with 70-75cm waist who ordered size 28"
- **Prioritize what those specific people experienced** over theoretical calculations
- If reviewers consistently say "runs small/large", adjust recommendation accordingly
- **Reviewer consensus from people with similar measurements is the final authority**

**FORMATTING RULES:**
- ALWAYS start recommendations with "Order size [NUMBER]" or "Order [SIZE]" - these MUST be the first 2-3 words
- Use the BRAND'S sizing format, not necessarily the user's preferred system
- NEVER use vague terms like "order your usual size" or "stick with your normal size"
- NEVER mention colors, style names, or product codes when giving size recommendations
- ALWAYS recommend ONE primary size first with confidence
- Only suggest a second size if there are SPECIFIC, ACTIONABLE conditions (e.g., "If you prefer a roomier fit, size up to 29")
- NEVER give vague advice like "order both and return what doesn't fit"
- When user measurements are available, MUST reference them explicitly in your reasoning

**Examples:**
- ✅ GOOD (waist-based brand WITH similar reviews): "Order size 28. Your 71cm waist (28 inches) matches size 28 in this brand's chart. Found 4 reviewers with 70-75cm waist who confirmed size 28 fits true to size."
- ✅ GOOD (waist-based brand WITHOUT similar reviews): "Order size 28. Your 71cm waist (28 inches) matches size 28 in this brand's chart. Reviews from people with your exact measurements aren't available, but the size chart indicates this is your best match."
- ✅ GOOD (UK sizing brand, user prefers UK): "Order UK 10. Your 71cm waist and 97cm hips align with UK 10 in this brand's size chart. 2 reviewers with similar measurements (70cm waist, 95cm hips) found UK 10 perfect."
- ✅ GOOD (US sizing brand, user prefers US): "Order US size 6. Based on your measurements and reviewer consensus from similar body types."
- ✅ GOOD (alpha sizing): "Order size M. Your measurements (71cm waist, 97cm hips) match the brand's medium sizing. 5 reviewers with similar measurements recommend size M."
- ❌ BAD (waist-based brand): "Order UK 18" when brand uses waist sizing (24, 25, 26...) - wrong format!
- ❌ BAD: "Order INDIO. Reviewers say..." (INDIO is not a size)
- ❌ BAD: "Order your usual size" (not specific)
- ❌ BAD: "Try size 28 or 29 and return what doesn't fit" (too vague)
- ❌ BAD: Recommending size 8 when user has 71cm waist and brand's size 8 fits 66cm waist (wrong calculation!)
- ❌ BAD: Not mentioning similar reviewers when they exist in the data

**If NO size chart or reviews available:** Be honest about limited data and provide best guidance based on user's measurements and brand reputation

Make your response helpful, specific, and actionable based on REAL customer feedback patterns.`;
